### What is Steganography
Steganography is the practice of hiding secret messages in otherwise non-secret mediums.

**Examples**:
- Changing the extension of a file; e.g. `file.txt` to `file.png`
- Embedding a file or message in another; e.g. `hidden.txt` as part of `file.doc`

#### Plain-text Passwords
Sometimes passwords are stored in rare files, folders, and places. Some locations are worth looking into:
- Recyclebin of the OS.
- Log files.
- History of the shell.
- In the draft or trash of email the account.
