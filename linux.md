# Concepts
### Path
- An **absolute pathname** begins with the root directory and follows the tree, branch by branch, until it reaches the desired directory or file. Absolute paths always start with `/`.
- A **relative pathname** starts from the present working directory. Relative paths never start with `/`.
- Multiple slashes (/) between directories and files are allowed: `////usr//bin` equals to `/usr/bin`.

### (Hard/Soft) Link to Files
- A hard link is a pointer to a file where if the original file is deleted, the linked file works separately (a idendical copy of the original file).
- A soft (symbolic) link is the same as hard link but if the original file is delete, it would not work (a link to the original file).

###  Command Line Prompt
- The `PS1` variable is the character string that is displayed as the prompt on the command line.
- By changing the variable $PS1, the command prompt get changed; [read more](https://linuxconfig.org/bash-prompt-basics) about the possiblities.

### Standard File Streams
- When commands are executed, by default there are three standard file streams (or descriptors) always open for use: standard input (standard in or `stdin`), standard output (standard out or `stdout`) and standard error (or `stderr`).
- Usually, `stdin` is your keyboard, and `stdout` and `stderr` are printed on your terminal.
- 0: `stdin`, 1: `stdout`, 2: `stderr`.

### Pipes
- Pipeline allows Linux to combine the actions of several commands into one.

# Commands

### Other Commands
```
$ shutdown -h 10:00 "comment"       # turn of the computer at 10:00; -r represents restart
$ poweroff                          # like shutdown -h
$ halt                              # like shutdown -h

$ which diff                        # show the full path of (shell) commands
$ whereis diff                      # locate the binary, source, and manual page files for a command

$ locate t1                                 # search for the term t1 within file and directory's name. It uses the database for the searh
$ updatedb                                  # update the database used by the command locate
$ locate t1 | grep t2                       # search for the term t1 while the list contains the term t2
$ find d1 -type d -name "log*"              # find directories in the d1 directory that start with the term log
$ find / -size +10M                         # find files/directories in the root with the size more than 10MB
$ find / -ctime 3                           # find files/directories in the root with the metadata change time older than 3 days; -cmin represents minute
$ find / -amin -3                           # find files/directories in the root with the read (access) time newer than 3 minutes; -amin represents minute
$ find / -mmin 3 -exec [command] {} ’;’     # find files/directories in the root with the write (modification) time older than 3 days and run the command for the result, e.g. rm (delete them)

$ ls f*                             # show the list of files/directories' names start with f and has zero or more charachter

$ rm -ri d1                         # remove contens of the directory d1 but interactively (ask the user for each deletion)

$ [command] > f1                    # run the command and write the output (stdout) in the file f1; 1> and > does the same
$ [command] 2> f1                   # run the command and write the error message (stderr) in the file f1
$ [command] >& f1                   # run the command and write the output and error message (stdout + stderr) in the file f1; >& and 2>&1 are the same
