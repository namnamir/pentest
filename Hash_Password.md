The other option is to use `hash identifier` tools.

# JavaScript `escape()` Function
The `escape()` function computes a new string in which certain characters have been replaced by a hexadecimal escape sequence. The function to decrypt it is `unescape()`.

```javascript
pass = '%63%70%61%73%62%69%65%6e%64%75%72%70%61%73%73%77%6f%72%64';
h = window.prompt('Enter password');
if(h == unescape(pass)) {
    alert('You an validate the challenge using this pass.');
} else {
    alert('Wrong password');
}
```
