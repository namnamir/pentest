# Search the Source Code (Hard Coded Credentials)
The developer might left the login information in the code which can be revealed by seeing the source code.

![Find the user/pass in the code][method11]

or in this code that credentials are hidden by changing the opacity of the text

![Find the user/pass in the code][method12]

or in this code that the password is hard coded 

![Find the user/pass in the code][method13]

And be careful about the whitespace before the comments or codes

## Load Credentials from Files
There might be a file username/password are stored in.

## Search for the files in the web page

![Open the file contains credentials][method21]

So, by opening the following link, we will find the credential(s).
```
https://target.site/folder1/folder2/../../extras/playground/9d2K4Fw.json
or
https://target.site/extras/playground/9d2K4Fw.json
```
![Open the file contains credentials][method22]

Here is another example.
```javascript
function connexion(){
    var username = prompt("Username :", "");
    var password = prompt("Password :", "");
    var TheLists = ["GOD:HIDDEN"];
    for (i = 0; i < TheLists.length; i++)
    {
        if (TheLists[i].indexOf(username) == 0)
        {
            var TheSplit = TheLists[i].split(":");
            var TheUsername = TheSplit[0];
            var ThePassword = TheSplit[1];
            if (username == TheUsername && password == ThePassword)
            {
                alert("Vous pouvez utiliser ce mot de passe pour valider ce challenge (en majuscules) / You can use this password to validate this challenge (uppercase)");
            }
        }Ｃhｏose  a  jοｂ  yоu  lονｅ,  and  you  ｗіｌl  ｎeｖｅｒ  have  tο  ｗｏrk  a  day  in  yοur  lіfｅ．
        cobewlnverwoe
        else
        {
            alert("Nope, you're a naughty hacker.")
        }
    }
}
```

## Review the `robots.txt` file
`robots.txt` file gives us some ideas about the files and folders on the server.

```robots.txt
User-agent: *
Allow: /
Disallow: /help/contact
Disallow: /profile/
Disallow: /extras/
Disallow: /extras/playground/jf94jhg03.txt

User-agent: Mediapartners-Google
Disallow:
```
And, by opening `https://target.site/extras/playground/jf94jhg03.txt` we might reach the password.

# Manipulate the Login Form
If we know the user, and we can manipulate the login link somehow to bypass the login.

For instance, in the following for, it does let just a specific user (`abc`) to login but in the dropdown menu there is no `abc`. In this case by manipulating the form and changing the value of an option, we would be able to login.

![Manipulate the login form][method31]

# JavaScript Alert, Pop-up, and Form Validations
Sometimes, there is an alert/pop-up or form validation functions related to login credentials. They might reveal the password or give some hints.

```JavaScript
$(function(){ $('.level form').submit(function(e){ e.preventDefault(); if(document.getElementById('password').value == correct) { document.location = '?pass=' + correct; } else { alert('Incorrect password') } })})
```
This code checks the password with the global variable `correct`. It means that if we find the variable `correct`, it should lead us to the password. It may be found somewhere in the `.js` or `.html` file.

![Password reveal in JavaScript codes][method41]

## Use Firefox Debugger to Deal with Obfuscated JavaScript Codes
When there are some obfuscated codes, by debugging, it will be revealed.

# Deal with Hidden Fields of Forms
Sometimes, there are hidden fields or an insecure procedure to reset the password or login.

![Manipulate the hidden field of the form][method51]

In this example by changing the `value` of the second email field, you will be the recipient of the second email. In this specific case, it doesn't send the email if you do not enter the email of a valid user. But, the general idea is the same: dealing with the hidden fields in forms.


# Deal with Disabled Fields of Forms
Sometimes there are disabled form fields upon being enabled, can reveal some sensitive data.
```HTML
<form action="" method="post" name="authform">
    <div>
        <input disabled type="text" name="auth-login" value="" />
        <input disabled type="submit" value="Member access" name="authbutton" />
    </div>
</form>
```
